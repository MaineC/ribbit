# Project selection

What are criteria after which you decide which projects to send your colleagues
to? Where should you invest your time, what are great targets for help and
support?

## How do you decide which projects to contribute to and invest in?i

* Obiously I'd go for business alignment.

* In a scratch your own itch kind of way I'd go for the projects I'm using and
  where I find bugs or where features are missing for my case.

* If I'm sending my colleagues I would first check the project's culture - I
  don't want them to end up in a toxic environment that doesn't want any support
and doesn't share ownership - especially if that's the first project they are
involved with.

* I'd check whether target projects are welcoming to newcomers, whether they
  have some sort of mentorship established - either formal or informal.
