# Contributor buy-in

## Which strategies were successful to inspire potential contributors?

The goal is to collect strategies that open source evangelists trying to convert
corporate developers to open source contributors can use.

### Company internal strategies

* [Start with an experiment](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/master/start-as-experiment.md)
* Encourage open source contributions for projects that are used in experiments
  and hacking sessions to establish a new tech stack.
* Encourage Inner Source methods for software development
* Introduce the same tooling for in-house software development that are common
  in open source projects
* Lowering the barriers for patches
   * Legal issues
   * Tooling issues
   * Process issues
   * Cultural barriers
      * Start with Inner Source
      * See innersourcecommons.org

* Instead of moving on from projects on the edge of being abandoned help keep
  them alive by donating your time to it - in particular for those that your
core business depends on.
* "For projects you use in your central business you get to push them in the
  direction that benefits your use case."

* Change the wording - instead of talking about locally maintained patches, talk
  about locally maintained forks of upstream projects that you carry the cost
form maintenance for.

* "Be specific about where visibility and credits for contributions go so people
  know where to look and where to point to.

* Make it simple to contribute, remove barriers inside of your organisation.

* Facilitate a shift in culture of your employer that supports and encourages
  open source upstream contributions.

* Educate your employer about the origins of open source components - and where
  there's a need for helping hands, as well as about what it means if downstream
users are not providing support.

* Highlight contributors, emphasize their support, both upstream and downstream.

* In a build or buy situation open source provides you with a build and buy
  outcome.

* Highlight how open source contributions are beneficial for the business bottom
  line, e.g. by enabling developers to try a product released as an open source
component to drive leads.
* Raise awareness of business value of up stream contributions in the entire
  company.
* Highlight costs of downstream forks.

### Strategies that projects can employ to make contributions easier

* Establish fast turnaround times for contributions: Quick feedback and review

* Provide stories that explain how others converted their employer

* Make contributions simple.

* Make it easy to get involved.

* Provide a very well defined process for how to get started and how to
  contribute.

* Be nice to new contributors and provide a warm welcome.

* Highlight contributors, emphasize their support, both upstream and downstream.

* Provide getting started tasks that are easy and do have impact.

* An active and friendly community will be more successful in attracting
  contributors.

## Which arguments were successful to inspire potential contributors?

* "You'll get feedback from great peers and experts in the field."

* "You'll get cool free swag"

* "You'll get better visibility, open source contributions do count on your CV"
* "You'll get visibility outside of your corporate development team."

* "Instead of waiting for others to fix your issue you can implement the
  features you need yourself and fix the bugs you encounter yourself and as a
result move faster in providing value to your customers."
* "Those bugs that annoy you - simply fix them."
* "Those features you find missing for your use case - simply implement them."

* "You'll learn a lot about how other projects are being run, what kind of build
  management, code quality tooling, test tooling and CI tooling they use"
* "Work on what you want when you want where you want"
* "It's a great oportunity for networking and meeting interesting people that
  you can learn from"

* "Patches maintained upstream are cheaper than locally maintained patches - you
  don't have to re-apply (and potentially modify them) on each new ustrream
release"
* "Your fix gone upstream will remain present in future versions which makes
  maintenance easier."
* "Not only maintenance cost will be shared - also development cost will be
  shared for new features."
* "Speed up development of features you need by helping build them."

* "You'll get the chance to contribute to the greater good by being part of
  something that is bigger than yourself"
* "By fixing things upstream you will help others as well."

* "You'll be in a good position to drive innovation"
* "You'll gain influence in the project you use daily."

* "You'll be able to gain more experience and get valuable feedback"

* "Instead of keeping documentation in your own blog post, why not contribute a
  documentation patch and link to the accepted patch on your blog post adding
validation to your publication."
