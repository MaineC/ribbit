# Contributor buy-in

## Which strategies were successful to inspire potential contributors?

The goal is to collect strategies that open source evangelists trying to convert
corporate developers to open source contributors can use.

### Company internal strategies

* [Start with an experiment](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/master/start-as-experiment.md)
* Encourage open source contributions for projects that are used in experiments
  and hacking sessions to establish a new tech stack.
* Encourage Inner Source methods for software development
* Introduce the same tooling for in-house software development that are common
  in open source projects
* Lowering the barriers for patches
   * Legal issues
   * Tooling issues
   * Process issues
   * Cultural barriers
      * Start with Inner Source
      * See innersourcecommons.org

### Strategies that projects can employ to make contributions easier

* Establish fast turnaround times for contributions: Quick feedback and review

* Provide stories that explain how others converted their employer


## Which arguments were successful to inspire potential contributors?

* "You'll get feedback from great peers and experts in the field."
* "You'll get cool free swag"
* "You'll get better visibility, open source contributions do count on your CV"
* "Instead of waiting for others to fix your issue you can implement the
  features you need yourself and fix the bugs you encounter yourself and as a
result move faster in providing value to your customers."
* "You'll learn a lot about how other projects are being run, what kind of build
  management, code quality tooling, test tooling and CI tooling they use"
* "Work on what you want when you want where you want"
* "It's a great oportunity for networking and meeting interesting people that
  you can learn from"
* "Patches maintained upstream are cheaper than locally maintained patches - you
  don't have to re-apply (and potentially modify them) on each new ustrream
release"
* "You'll get the chance to contribute to the greater good by being part of
  something that is bigger than yourself"
* "You'll be in a good position to drive innovation"
* "You'll be able to gain more experience and get valuable feedback"
* "Instead of keeping documentation in your own blog post, why not contribute a
  documentation patch and link to the accepted patch on your blog post adding
validation to your publication."
