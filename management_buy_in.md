# Management Buy In

The goal is to collect strategies and arguments that employees can use in order
to increase buy-in for upstream first development from a leadership perspective.

## Which strategies were successful to reach management buy-in?

* Push for re-use and modification of existing projects instead of re-inventing
  the wheel to safe development cycles.
* Support with developing a vision for open source involvement.
* Develop an understanding of how to use open source involvement stragtegically
  - for instance by creating selling possibilities for your own product through
    the open source project or by pushing a de-facto standard by providing open
source implementations.
* It helps to take a data driven approach and show benefits in terms of hard
  business metrics.


## Which arguments were successful to reach management buy-in?

* "Open source is a great way of pushing your own development as a standard by
  providing example implementations under a free license."

* "We can leverage open source contributions in order to develop experts for the
  technologies we use in house. The mentoring and coaching they receive when
making contributions will turn them into more efficient and proficient
developers."
* "We can develop more and better in-house expertise."
* "Having more of that knowledge in house means we need to spend less money on
  buying external experts, or on training internal developers."

* "Being part of the upstream project will enable us to see and react to bugs
  and security issues faster."
* "Contributing fixes instead of relying on workarounds or locally maintained
  patches frees time for our in-house development."
* "Making and contributing patches helps avoid technical debt - in particular
  related to workarounds that we created to deal with deficiencies."

* "Being involved upstream provides a way to steer the project in a direction
  that is beneficial for us"

* "Contributing patches gives us access to mentoring, coaching and consulting
  for free from the community around the project"
* "Contributing patches upstream means that they go through a serious feedback
  cycle which results in higher quality."

* "Being active upstream is a great benefit in terms of employer branding"
* "Being active upstream helps with attracting new talent."

* "Being active upstream shows our customers that we are good open source
  citizens and technological leaders in the field which helps with product
marketing."
* "Being active upstream helps increase company reputation for technological
  leadership."

* "Being active upstream means that we can position ourselves as driving
  innovation."
* "Contributing upstream means that we gain visibility amongst potential new
  hires and potential customers."

* "Contributing upstream instead of maintaining locally means that we can
  delegate the maintenance overhead to the upstream project."
* "Essentially upstream contributions mean that external people will help you
  build what you need so you are sharing the cost."
* "We can delegate maintenance of our patches which helps with cost saving."

* "Ensuring patches are contributed upstream makes it much easier for other
  consultancies to continue the work I've done because most of the work I've
done is part of the standard free and open source software stack already. So for
you as a customer of some consultancy it's actually beneficial to make sure that
what those freelancers are doing is contributed upstream."
