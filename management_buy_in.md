# Management Buy In

The goal is to collect strategies and arguments that employees can use in order
to increase buy-in for upstream first development from a leadership perspective.

## Which strategies were successful to reach management buy-in?

* Push for re-use and modification of existing projects instead of re-inventing
  the wheel to safe development cycles.

## Which arguments were successful to reach management buy-in?

* "Open source is a great way of pushing your own development as a standard by
  providing example implementations under a free license."
* "We can leverage open source contributions in order to develop experts for the
  technologies we use in house. The mentoring and coaching they receive when
making contributions will turn them into more efficient and proficient
developers."
* "Being part of the upstream project will enable us to see and react to bugs
  and security issues faster."
* "Contributing fixes instead of relying on workarounds or locally maintained
  patches frees time for our in-house development."
* "Being involved upstream provides a way to steer the project in a direction
  that is beneficial for us"
* "Contributing patches gives us access to mentoring, coaching and consulting
  for free from the community around the project"
* "Contributing patches upstream means that they go through a serious feedback
  cycle which results in higher quality."
* "Being active upstream is a great benefit in terms of employer branding"
* "Being active upstream means that we can position ourselves as driving
  innovation."
* "Contributing upstream means that we gain visibility amongst potential new
  hires and potential customers."
* "Contributing upstream instead of maintaining locally means that we can
  delegate the maintenance overhead to the upstream project."
